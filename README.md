IGNIS and ARDR coins will be allocated to user accounts in the Ardor genesis block. Their distribution will be based on a one-time snapshot conducted over the Nxt blockchain (the "Ardor Genesis Snapshot"), to be performed shortly before the Ardor launch, as follows:
IGNIS distribution

The total amount of IGNIS coins issued will be equal to half of the amount of NXT coins existing on the Nxt blockchain at the time of the Ardor Genesis Snapshot, plus 500 M (five hundred million).

Half of the IGNIS coins will be reserved and distributed automatically to the NXT holders based on their account balances at the time of the Ardor Genesis Snapshot, at 1 NXT = 0.5 IGNIS ratio.

The other half of the IGNIS coin supply was partially used by Jelurida to conduct a successful IGNIS Token Sale over a period of three months (Aug 05 - Nov 04), collecting 167 M NXT, which were partially converted to fiat, Bitcoin, and Ardor. As of the end of the token sale, the total proceeds were over $15 000 000. These funds will be used for the further development, maintenance, advancement and world-wide promotion of the Nxt and Ardor blockchain platforms, as well as protecting the intellectual property of the code base.

The token sale was conducted on the Nxt blockchain platform, using a "controllable currency" called JLRDA. For 1 JLRDA token the participants in the ICO will receive 1 IGNIS coin at the time of the Ardor Genesis Snapshot. (See the IGNIS Token Sale Whitepaper for a detailed overview of the IGNIS crowdsale and the Ardor Platform.)

The Ardor Genesis Snapshot is planned for Dec 28th, 2017, at block height 1636363. The Ardor production software release will be done shortly after the snapshot, with the blockchain scheduled to start exactly on Jan 1, 2018, 00:00:00 UTC.

ARDR distribution

The ARDR coin distribution will be 100% based on ARDR asset balances (asset id: 12422608354438203866) from the Nxt blockchain, in 1:1 ratio, with each user account automatically receiving the same number of ARDR coins on the Ardor platform as the number of ARDR tokens they have at the time of the snapshot. As a reminder, ARDR tokens on the Nxt blockchain were allocated to NXT holders based on their average NXT balances during a three month period in 2016. ARDR tokens have been freely tradeable ever since. No new ARDR coins will be created.

FAKE TOKENS WARNING

It is possible that fake tokens with similar or the same name created by third parties also appear in other areas of the wallet such as the Asset Exchange or the Marketplace. Due to decentralized nature of the blockchain it is not possible to prevent the creation of such tokens and the Company shall not be held responsible for any losses or damages, or inability to receive IGNIS, arising from users purchasing such third party tokens.

SINCE JLRDA TOKENS ARE NOT TRADEABLE AND NOT TRANSFERABLE, ANY THIRD PARTIES TRYING TO SELL YOU JLRDA TOKENS ARE SELLING YOU FAKES!

TRADING OF ARDR TOKENS ON THE NXT BLOCKCHAIN IS NOW ALSO DISABLED, AS THE ARDOR GENESIS SNAPSHOT HAS ALREADY BEEN TAKEN. DO NOT BUY ANY FAKE ARDR OR SIMILARLY NAMED TOKENS ON THE NXT BLOCKCHAIN!
